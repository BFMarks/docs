## Overview

Cloom AI uses SendGrid to send authenticated emails on your behalf. This guide walks you through configuring your domain to send emails through Cloom AI.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- Access to your domain's DNS settings (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)
- A dedicated email address or subdomain for sending
- Administrative access to your Cloom AI account

## Choosing Your Sending Domain

<Warning>
  **Important:** Do not use your root domain (e.g., `help@company.com`) as your sending address.

  Cloom AI will be able to intercept all emails sent to that domain. For example, if you set up `help@company.com`, Cloom can read all emails sent to `*@company.com`.
</Warning>

### Recommended Approaches

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Subdomain" icon="sitemap">
    **Best Practice:** Use a subdomain

    `something@ai.company.com` (e.g., `help@ai.tesla.com`)

    This isolates your AI email handling from your main domain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Separate Domain" icon="globe">
    **Alternative:** Create a dedicated domain

    `help@company-support.com` (e.g., `help@tesla-team.com`)

    This provides complete separation from your primary domain.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 1: Access Email Configuration

1. Navigate to **Settings** from the main menu
2. Click **Email Sending** tab
3. Click **Outbound** section
4. Click **+ Create Sending Configuration**

## Step 2: Create Sending Configuration

Enter your email details:

<ParamField path="Sending Email Address" type="string" required>
  The complete email address you want to send from

  Example: `hola@elegi.cloom.ai`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Verified Domain" type="string" required>
  The domain name (extracted automatically from your email address)

  Example: `elegi.cloom.ai`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="SendGrid Subdomain" type="string" required>
  A subdomain prefix for email authentication (usually your brand or "mail")

  Example: `s1`
</ParamField>

### DKIM and SPF Configuration

<Note>
  Cloom AI automatically manages SPF and DKIM email authentication to improve deliverability and prevent spoofing.
</Note>

Check the box to enable:
- ✅ **Enable Automatic SPF/DKIM Management** (Recommended)

## Step 3: Add DNS Records

After creating your sending configuration, you'll receive DNS records to add to your domain:

### DNS Record Types

You'll need to add three types of CNAME records:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Domain Verification Record">
    **Type:** CNAME

    **Host/Name:** `s1._domainkey.elegi`

    **Value:** Provided by Cloom AI

    **Purpose:** Verifies domain ownership
  </Step>

  <Step title="DKIM Authentication Records">
    **Type:** CNAME (2 records)

    **Host/Name:** `s1._domainkey` and `s2._domainkey`

    **Value:** Provided by Cloom AI

    **Purpose:** Email authentication and deliverability
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Update Your DNS Provider

The exact steps depend on your DNS provider:

### Example: Adding CNAME Records

Most DNS providers follow a similar pattern:

1. Log in to your DNS provider (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.)
2. Navigate to DNS management for your domain
3. Click **Add Record**
4. Select **CNAME** as record type
5. Enter the **Host/Name** from Cloom AI
6. Enter the **Value/Points To** from Cloom AI
7. Set TTL to **Automatic** or **3600**
8. Save the record
9. Repeat for all CNAME records

### Common DNS Providers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="GoDaddy" icon="globe">
    1. Go to DNS Management
    2. Click "Add" under Records
    3. Select "CNAME" type
    4. Enter Host and Points to values
    5. Click "Save"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Namecheap" icon="globe">
    1. Go to Advanced DNS
    2. Click "Add New Record"
    3. Select "CNAME Record"
    4. Enter Host and Target values
    5. Click "Save Changes"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cloudflare" icon="cloud">
    1. Go to DNS settings
    2. Click "Add Record"
    3. Select "CNAME"
    4. Enter Name and Target
    5. Toggle proxy status to "DNS only"
    6. Click "Save"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Google Domains" icon="globe">
    1. Go to DNS settings
    2. Scroll to Custom Records
    3. Select "CNAME" type
    4. Enter Host name and Data
    5. Click "Add"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 5: Verify Configuration

DNS changes can take 30-60 minutes to propagate.

Once the DNS has propagated:

1. Return to your email configuration in Cloom AI
2. Click the **Verify** button
3. Wait for confirmation that records are validated

<Check>
  ✅ **Success!** Your domain is now verified and ready to send emails.
</Check>

### Verification Failed?

If verification fails:

- **Wait longer**: DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours
- **Check records**: Ensure CNAME records were entered exactly as provided
- **Remove extra characters**: Some DNS providers add the domain automatically; avoid duplication
- **Contact support**: Reach out to your Cloom AI representative for assistance

## Testing Email Sending

Once verified, test your email setup:

1. Create an outbound email node in a workflow
2. Add a test recipient email address
3. Send a test email
4. Check that it arrives and is not marked as spam

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Emails Going to Spam" icon="shield">
    - Verify all DNS records are correctly configured
    - Check that SPF/DKIM are passing (use a tool like mail-tester.com)
    - Ensure your sending domain has a good reputation
    - Add an unsubscribe link to your emails
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="DNS Records Not Validating" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    - Double-check for typos in CNAME records
    - Ensure you didn't include quotes in the values
    - Verify the subdomain prefix matches your configuration
    - Contact your DNS provider's support if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot Add CNAME Records" icon="ban">
    - Some hosts don't allow CNAME records on root domains
    - Try using a subdomain instead
    - Check if your DNS provider has specific formatting requirements
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
