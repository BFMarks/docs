## Using Analytics to Improve

### Identify Common Issues

Review transcripts to find:
- Frequently asked questions not covered in your knowledge base
- Routes that need clearer instructions
- Variables that aren't being extracted correctly

### Optimize Call Flows

Use analytics to:
- Identify the most common routes taken
- Find bottlenecks in conversations
- Improve voice prompts based on user confusion
- Adjust routing logic for better accuracy

### Monitor Performance

Track metrics over time:
- Are call durations increasing or decreasing?
- Is the contact rate improving?
- Are certain times of day busier than others?

## Troubleshooting

### No Calls Showing

If you don't see any calls:
- Verify your phone number is correctly configured
- Check that your workflow is activated
- Confirm the ElevenLabs webhook is set up correctly
- Test by calling the number directly

### Missing Recordings

If recordings aren't available:
- Check that recording is enabled in your ElevenLabs agent settings
- Verify webhook events include audio data
- Contact support if the issue persists

### Incorrect Transcripts

If transcripts seem inaccurate:
- Review the actual recording to compare
- Consider adjusting your ElevenLabs agent's language settings
- Check for background noise or poor connection quality
