## Overview

Cloom AI supports SMS messaging through Twilio and Infobip, allowing you to create intelligent text message workflows that can respond to customer inquiries automatically.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up SMS, you'll need:

- A Twilio or Infobip account
- A dedicated SMS number
- Your Cloom AI account with appropriate permissions

## Phone Number Format

SMS numbers must be in E.164 format:

✅ **Correct:**
- `+16673270565`
- `+442071234567`
- `+61412345678`

❌ **Incorrect:**
- `+1 667 327 0565` (contains spaces)
- `(667) 327-0565` (wrong format)
- `6673270565` (missing country code)

<Note>
  Always include the country code and remove any spaces, dashes, or parentheses.
</Note>

## Setting Up SMS with Twilio

### Step 1: Configure Twilio Webhook

In your Twilio console:

1. Navigate to your phone number settings
2. Find the **Messaging** section
3. Set the webhook URL to: `https://api.cloom.ai/messaging/twilio-sms-webhook/`
4. Set the HTTP method to **POST**
5. Save your changes

### Step 2: Add Number to Cloom

Contact your Cloom AI representative to add your Twilio number to your account. Provide:

- Your phone number in E.164 format
- Your project name
- Which workflow should handle messages to this number

<Warning>
  Currently, Twilio numbers must be manually configured. Infobip dynamic setup is coming soon.
</Warning>

## Creating an SMS Node

In your Cloom AI workflow:

1. Click **Create Agent Journey** or **Start & Integrate**
2. Select **Incoming SMS** as the start node type (if receiving messages)
3. Or add an **SMS** node anywhere in your workflow (for sending messages)

## SMS Template Editor

### Message Content

Create your SMS message template:

**Name**
- Give your template a descriptive name (e.g., "Order Status Reply")

**Message**
- Write your SMS message content
- Keep it under 160 characters for single SMS
- Use variables to personalize: `{{customer_name}}`

```text Example SMS
Gracias por su llamada y por sus preguntas. No dude en
ponerse en contacto con nosotros si tiene alguna otra
pregunta. - Elegi+
```

### Character Count

The editor shows your character count:
- 127/160 - Within single SMS limit ✅
- 180/160 - Will send as 2 messages ⚠️

<Tip>
  Messages over 160 characters will be sent as multiple SMS messages, which may increase costs.
</Tip>

## SMS Routing

SMS routing works differently than voice:

### Automatic Follow-ups

Unlike voice calls, SMS bots will **automatically ask follow-up questions** until they have all required information.

**Example Flow:**

```
Bot: Thanks for reaching out! I can help track your order.

User: Where is my package?

Bot: I'd be happy to help! Can you provide your order number?

User: 123456

Bot: Thank you! When did you place this order?

User: December 10th

Bot: [Proceeds to next node with order_number=123456 and order_date=Dec 10]
```

### Mandatory Variables

Configure which variables must be collected before proceeding:

1. Navigate to the **Routes** tab
2. Select your route
3. Add variables under **Mandatory Variables**
4. The AI will ask for any missing variables automatically

## Testing Your SMS

To test your SMS workflow:

1. Ensure your workflow is activated (toggle in top left)
2. Click **Send Test** in the SMS Template Editor
3. Enter your phone number
4. Click **Send Test SMS**
5. Reply to the message to test the conversation flow
